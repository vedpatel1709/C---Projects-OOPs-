In this workshop 8 and milestone 2, I was able to learn more about inheritance. I learned how to define pure virtual functions. I used "Virtual" sign to make function virtual. This virtual function will override the function of the base class from the derived class. To make any function pure virtual function, I will have to add some keywords in function.
Moreover, from the milestone 2, I learned about Abstract classes. A class that has a pure virtual function is called "abstract base class". While, a concrete class is an ordinary class which has no purely virtual functions and hence can be instantiated.
Furthermore, in this concept of inheritance it is important to implement destructor. In some situation where classes inherit from each other, the destructor should be made a virtual function because both the actual and the underlying objects must be destroyed.
Overall, I found that workshop 8 quite difficult because we created around 4 classes and we inherited concrete classes into one abstract class.
