 /*I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.*/

This workshop focused on creating and implementing class templates, as well as customizing a templated class variable for a specific type and customizing a templated class member function to process a certain type.
According to the workshop's guidelines, I only implemented one.cpp module, "Pair.cpp." All of the other modules were built using header files that defined functions.
I used the "add" function in the collection module to verify whether an element was added or not in this workshop.
I also added a function to the set module that checks whether an element has been added or not. In addition, I override the "add" function to prevent the same element from being added many times.
I also used the inheritance principle to create a new class called "Set" from a base class called "collection." The Set and Collection classes were both fully templated.
This session goes over the templates we talked about last week.
This workshop is terrific learning, and it's challenging for me as well.
