// workshop 2 part 2

I learned many new things in this workshop-2.
In part-1, I wrote the functions which will find out the winner among 4 fighters who have more power by comparing each fighter.
Moreover, I learned how can we allocate dynamic memory when the size of an existing array is increased. I used that technique to add new fighters into an existing array of fighters.
I also learned how can we deallocate the dynamic memory when the size of an existing array is decreased. I found this concept quite confusing because I have never seen such a thing before in c language.
I found workshop-2 part-2 very easy. I completed it within 30 minutes without error or bug. I learned some new “cin” statements of C++.
Those statements are really time-saving especially “cin().ignore” and “cin().getline”.

Overall, I learned many new things from this workshop and this workshop was exciting for me.
