/*I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.*/

In this workshop, we discussed Standard Template Library Algorithms, from which I learned how to create an applicate that handles all the data and maintains it. 
As a result of attending this workshop, I was able to learn about some interesting topics, including copying data and records to sequential containers from any file.
The lambda expressions that I used to define operations on each value also worked well for me. CovidCollection is the only module that was used in this workshop, so our work was simple and straightforward.
There is just one struct in this module that contains information such as a country, city, variety, year, number of cases, and number of deaths. For example, in getListForCountry(), it gets any country name and then gives us the covid list of that country. I liked "std::list*Covid> getListForVariant() const" because it gets any country name and then gives us the covid list. 
Once the variant is known, it gives us a covid list for that specific variant using getListforVariant(). My next step was to learn how to sort the data in ascending order using the sort() function. 
I found the workshop to be simple and short, but it was worth learning and getting to know a few new topics.
