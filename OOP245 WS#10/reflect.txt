I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

While working on workshop 10, I learned a new concept called templates. In the beginning, it looked scary but it was easy to understand. templates allow us to create a function template whose functionality can be adapted to more than one type or class without repeating the entire code for each type.
Using the template, we can save a lot of time as we do not need to create the same function with data types.
In this workshop, I learned how to create templates with one parameter and with multiple parameters.
In file main.cpp, we were supposed to write parameters of function using the concept of the template. That helped me a lot to understand how templates really work. 
Overall, this workshop was the easiest and smallest of all time.
While working on milestone 4, I found a lot of confusion. According to instructions, we can use the publication module from milestone 3 but when I used that same module my code didn't work. I needed to implement the publication module because I was using the publication class as a parent class of Book class.
Overall, I learned about the rule of three in that milestone but I missed the submission by a small margin and submitted it late.s
