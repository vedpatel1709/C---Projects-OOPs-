/*I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.*/

The workshop covered a wide range of C++ subjects, and the professor went over many of them in detail in the notes and online sessions.
Externally linked symbols will be accessible throughout your application, while internally linked symbols will only be accessible within one translation unit.
I declared "g_taxrate" and "g_dailydiscount" as external linkages in this workshop. Because it may be accessible from the main function when a new day of orders begins, and we declared it previously in the header file, but the definition is in the.cpp file. In the.cpp module, I also declared Counter no as an internal linkage inside namespace.
A static variable is a variable, which means it has the same lifespan as the rest of the code. To print order data with a number, I utilised the static variable Counter no. I utilised it such that whenever the display function is invoked, it uses the previously used Counter no and increments it by one.
I used some string-based shortcuts while updating to part 2. For instance, I used the string.getline() function to take input values up to "," ignore "," and save the data in a variable.
