/*I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.*/

I found this workshop to be really easy and small in comparison to others I've attended in the past.
We were supposed to create two functions based on the process_data module provided on GitHub.
I have learned many valuable concepts from this workshop, despite it being so small.
The most important part of this course was learning how to write numbers into a file in binary mode and read numbers out of a file in binary mode.
In addition, I learned the difference between multi-tasking and multi-threading and how we can bind functions to their arguments.  There is a difference between a process and a thread which can be explained by the distinction between them.
In this function, placeholders help to manipulate the position and number of values used by the function and modify the function according to the desired result.
As a final point, I learned how to partition data on a multithreaded system.
